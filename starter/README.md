## Getting Started

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Prerequisites
- react 17.0.2 or later
- node.js 16.15.0 or later

## Deployment
[`For deployment`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment)

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
